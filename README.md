# TokenTalk

I am building TokenTalk for Bitcoin Startup Lab's [Bitcoin Olympics Hackathon](https://btcolympics.devpost.com/)! 

TokenTalk is a BRC-20 token social forum where users can rate, chat about, and observe metrics for their favorite BRC-20 tokens! 

The project utilizes React, CoinGecko Public APIs, Bootstrap..and includes chatbox, account management, and search navigation features.

Check out the [video demo here](https://github.com/theresa-whynot/tokentalk/blob/main/TokenTalkDemo.mp4)
