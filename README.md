# tokentalk
I am building TokenTalk for Bitcoin Startup Lab's Bitcoin Olympics Hackathon! 

TokenTalk is a BRC-20 token social forum where users can rate, chat about, and observe metrics for their favorite BRC-20 Tokens! 

The project utilizes React, CoinGeck Public API, Bootstrap..and includes chatbox, account management, and search naivation features.

Coming soon! Check out the home page mockup for now.
